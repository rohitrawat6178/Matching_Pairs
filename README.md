# Matching_Pairs

Matching Pairs is an application game and the goal of the game was to match two equal cards, have them stay open, change colour and continue this way until all cards have been matched together. Some other additions that were needed included a Themes like cartoons, number, alphabets, shapes, animals etc, reset button that can be clicked at any time to reset the game, a timer that would start as soon as the game is loaded, and a score depending on how much time it took to finish the game. 

• Matching Pairs games for kids are fun and challenging, develop thinking skills, concentration and attention span, build persistence give children the chance to try new things without fear of failure. 
• Our main purpose was to develop this game to increase the concentration power of the children’s. 
• Matching Pairs Game can improve visual recognition. 
• In the present scenario, they have only Colour match but in my project there is many themes like(Cartoons, Number, Alphabets, Colours, Shapes, Animals ) + Icons (different).
